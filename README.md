# The Bingley Games
**The Bingley Games** is a Minecraft Java map for 1.20.6+ that has lots of fun minigames and customisation. It's currently still a WIP.

## How to Test
Download the zip file from: https://github.com/BingleyPro/bingleygames/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha
Extract the file into your Minecraft 1.20.6 saves folder. To find your saves folder with the vanilla Minecraft launcher, here's a third-party guide: https://www.howtogeek.com/207484/how-to-find-your-minecraft-saved-games-folder/
